# WorkIt: An app to log the times you worked out

[WorkIt](https://laurpaik.github.io/WorkIt/) is a web app that allows users to log the dates that they worked out. A user can create an athlete profile when they sign up. Once they log in, they can pick a workout provided and log the date based on the workout's ID.
